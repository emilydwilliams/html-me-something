         <p>I love a good campfire. Camping is especially wonderful in the fall. Virtually no bugs (besides one cool stick bug we saw), less crowded camp sites, and cozy blankets all make fall camping preferable to camping in the height of summer. But the absolute best part of fall camping is the warmth and glow of the campfire. I know, I know. We light campfires in the summer, too. But it's not the same. The feel of a warm, crackling fire beneath cold fingers is unmatched by anything summer camping has to offer.</p>

         <h3 class="article-header">Coffee <em>(Cafe&#769;)</em></h3>
         <p>Every time I go camping, I get better at it. Practice makes perfect. This time instead of instant coffee, I brought a chemex and some freshly ground Goshen coffee. I warmed my water in a kettle on the fire, then made the coffee pour-over style in the chemex. Coffee being one of my favorite tastes <em>and</em> smells, this high quality treat really heightened the camping experience for me.</p>

         <h3 class="article-header">Vineyard <em>(Vignoble)</em></h3>
         <p>A few miles from our campsite is a vineyard called Edg-Clif. We went there for a mid-afternoon excursion. I had a glass of their Chambourcin, and it was delicious. I'm a big fan of a good dry red. There was live music. A small group of guitarists playing oldies. They played a lovely Fleetwood Mac cover. My friends and I talked over wine with rolling hills of multi-colored trees all around us.</p>

       <article id="smores">
         <h3 class="article-header">S'mores <em>(They don't have a word for this in French)</em></h3>
         <p>S'mores are a classic and, in my opinion, necessary part of camping. It's more complicated to enjoy a good s'more when you become vegan, as I did roughly 6 years ago. But as I said before, practice makes perfect. I know where to buy vegan marshmallows (Whole Foods), dark chocolate bars (Aldi), and honey-less graham crackers (Schnucks). The funny thing was that I could only find vegan <em>mini</em> marshmallows, so I had to create a little foil bed for my tiny treats to lie in over the fire. (Sorry I didn't take any pictures of my s'mores.)</p>

         <p>One of our friends brought her sweet doggo camping. Her name is Pepper (the dog, not the friend). She is pictured below. We also saw THREE cute dogs at the vineyard. It was great.</p>
